I am an applied mathematician and data scientist.  My mathematical interests include applications of mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques to problems involving large-scale datasets, algorithmic foundations of optimization, and geometric and topological combinatorics questions that arise from social science applications (such as voting and fairness).


Previously, I was a clinical faculty member in the Department of Mathematics at New York University, where I taught a wide range of undergraduate mathematics courses and led a college-wide effort to revamp the quantitative reasoning element of the undergraduate general education curriculum.  I earned my PhD in Operations Research at Cornell University, where I was advised by James Renegar, and my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Harvey Mudd College.

I earned my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Harvey Mudd College and my PhD in Operations Research at Cornell University.  At Cornell, I focused algorithmic foundations for convex optimization and was advised by James Renegar.  From 2014 to 2022, I was a clinical faculty member in the Department of Mathematics at New York University, where I taught a wide range of undergraduate mathematics courses and led a university-wide effort to revamp the quantitative reasoning element of the undergraduate general education curriculum.  As an educator, I enjoyed developing <a href="/teaching">hands-on course materials and projects</a> that connect foundational mathematical ideas to modern applications in numerical linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, and data science.

In my academic research work, I enjoy thinking about how ideas from convex optimization, combinatorics, and geometry can help answer questions that come from the social sciences (including voting and fairness).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Research at Cornell University in 2014; my dissertation work centered around the design and analysis of an optimization algorithm for convex optimization (linear and semidefinite programming).  I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematics in 2008 from Harvey Mudd College.
