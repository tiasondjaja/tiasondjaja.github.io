*****

I am a Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at New York University (NYU), where I have been since September 2014.  

As a math educator, I enjoy developing <a href="/teaching">hands-on course materials and projects</a> that connect foundational mathematical ideas to modern applications in numerical linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, and data science.

My mathematical interests include optimization algorithms, and geometric and topological combinatorics questions that arise from social science applications (such as voting and fairness). Prior to NYU, I completed my PhD in Operations Research at Cornell University, where I was advised by James Renegar; I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Harvey Mudd College.

In my academic research work, I enjoy thinking about how ideas from convex optimization, combinatorics, and geometry can help answer questions that come from the social sciences (including voting and fairness).

<!--I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Research at Cornell University in 2014; my dissertation work centered around the design and analysis of an optimization algorithm for convex optimization (linear and semidefinite programming).  I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematics in 2008 from Harvey Mudd College.
