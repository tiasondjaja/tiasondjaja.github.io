I am a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU, where my primary interests and responsibilities are undergraduate teaching.

I completed my Ph.D. in Operations Research at Cornell University in 2014, where my research interests were in convex optimization. I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematics in 2008 from Harvey Mudd College.
